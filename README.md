# used-car-price-prediction

## Abstract
The project begins with data discovery and preprocessing to ensure data quality. Exploratory data analysis techniques such as ANOVA and correlation analysis provide insights into the relationships between car features and prices.

Since the dataset includes categorical features, data encoding is performed to convert them into numerical features. The data is split into training and testing sets for model development. 
Multiple modeling approaches —linear regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest regressor, and neural networks— are evaluated to determine the most effective method for predicting used car prices.

To enhance model performance, Data Standardization and principal component analysis (PCA) are explored for optimization. Hyperparameter tuning is automated to achieve optimal model performance.

A comparative analysis assesses the performance of each modeling approach, aiming to identify the best method for predicting used car prices. The project concludes with insights into the impact of Data Standardization and PCA on model effectiveness.
